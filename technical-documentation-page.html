            <p>Marksmanship Hunters are the only Hunter spec that have the option of not using a pet. It's typically the go-to spec for any player that does not like using or managing pets, but still want to play Hunter. It's typically referred to as the "sniper" spec with slower, heavy-hitting shots and an extended range. In Shadowlands, Marksmanship has transitioned into a more bursty class, having a "Burst and Reload" type feeling to its rotation.</p>
            <p>Nearly all Marksmanship abilities cost Focus. For us, our Focus pool regenerates rather slowly (unlike Beast Mastery Hunters for example). Marksmanship has more "active" Focus generation, meaning abilities such as Steady Shot must be used in order to sufficiently perform the rotation. At its core, Marksmanship uses  Aimed Shot to enable  Precise Shots while using abilities such as  Rapid Fire and  Steady Shot to regenerate Focus.</p>
            <p>Marksmanship is also fairly adaptable in terms of how it deals damage. Talents such as  Steady Focus and  Lock and Load give us some solid single target damage, while others like  Explosive Shot and  Volley give us some burst AoE potential. If you played Marksmanship in Battle for Azeroth, the current iteration plays very similarly with a few minor tweaks.</p>

            <p>With many different sources of gearing and loot scarcity in Shadowlands, targeting your absolute Best in Slot gear isn't entirely realistic; instead, we've created a Best in Slot list from the ideal Marksmanship Hunter raid drops found in Shadowlands, from Mythic Dungeons, to help you decide what to prioritize.</p>
            <p>These lists should give you several gearing paths in Season 2 including Sanctum of Domination, Mythic+, and Tazavesh, the Veiled Market. Give the following guide a read to learn about all gearing options in Shadowlands Season 2.</p>
            <h4>Sanctum of Domination Best in Slot Gear</h4>
            <p>Below is a compiled list of gear that comes strictly from Sanctum of Domination. Outside pieces of gear (such as dungeon gear) is not factored in this list. For most raid content, we'll be running  Serpentstalker's Trickery in the Ring slot for our legendary. For AoE encounters, most Hunters will be running  Surging Shots in the Neck slot. Additionally,  Weathered Talisman of the Shadowmoon and  Brynja's Mournful Wristwraps are within margin of error when compared to the items listed below in the Neck and Wrist spot respectively. Ultimately, the list below is merely a suggestion and I highly suggest simming yourself with Raidbots for the best results.</p>

            <p>Marksman Hunters in Shadowlands will have some variation in what talents they take depending on the type of encounter they face. Situational descriptions of each talent are listed below the talent tree. Marksmanship has a few talents that are relatively close to each other. As always, I recommend simming yourself to find the best talent setup for your character.</p>
            <p>The following MM Hunter builds were developed based on mathematical analysis and simulations, along with some common sense. There are situations where one Talent may give you more potential DPS than another, but still not be preferable if it has too many other drawbacks. This is generally the case in talents that do significant AoE damage but cause you to perform significantly less priority target damage. With that said, different teams have different needs, and experimenting with various builds to see what works best with your specific set of circumstances is always advisable.</p>

          <header>Stats</header>
          <article>
            <p>Shadowlands brings very radical changes in the field of stats for every class. With Diminishing Returns added to secondary stats, the idea of stacking one single stat is something that is seen less often. On top of that, Shadowlands brings another item level squish that reduces the item level bloat from previous expansions.</p>
            <p><code><b>Agility</b> is your primary stat, found on mail gear. Agility increases your attack power and damage done on all abilities.</code></p>
            <p>For secondary stats, Marksmanship Hunter has the following:</p>
            <div class="secondary-stats">
              <ul>
                <li><code><b>Critical Strike</b>: Critical Strike has skyrocketed to the forefront as our best single target stat. A couple of different factors such as  Kill Shot Rank 2 and  Master Marksman play a major role. As the target count increases, Crit starts to fall off a bit.</code></li>
                <li><code><b>Haste</b>: Haste has fallen in relevance for Marksmanship. While Haste does improve focus generation and reduces cast time, Marksmanship's damage is largely limited by  Aimed Shot charges. While it isn't necessarily bad, other stats are typically better to aim for.</code></li>
                <li><code><b>Mastery</b>: Mastery is our second-best stat. While it's a bit behind Crit in pure single target situations, it gains value in multiple target scenarios. Mastery falls off when a pet is required since pets do not scale with our Mastery.</code></li>
                <li><code><b>Versatility</b>: Increases all the damage you do, and reduces all damage taken. A decent stat to have that also provides a bit of survivability.</code></li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-priority">
              <h4>Single Target with Lonewolf</h4>
              <p><i>Weapon DPS >>> Agility >> Critical Strike > Mastery > Haste >= Versatility</i></p>
              <h4>Single Target with Pet</h4>
              <p><i>Weapon DPS >>> Agility >> Critical Strike > Mastery >= Haste >= Versatility</i></p>
              <h4>Multiple Target</h4>
              <p><i>Weapon DPS >>> Agility >> Critical Strike >= Mastery > Haste >= Versatility</i></p>
            </div>
            <p>As you can see with the above trend, Critical Strike is now our go-to in every situation. Mastery tends to catch up as you add targets. While using a pet, Mastery loses value while Critical Strike, Versatility, and Haste gain value since our pet does not benefit from Mastery. I recommend gearing towards a mix of both Critical Strike and Mastery.</p>

            <p>In Shadowlands, multiple pieces of gear can have enchants. For mail users, we can enchant Weapons, Rings, Chest, Cloaks, Gloves, and Boots. Shadowlands also brings some new items - Oils and Sharpening Stones. For Marksmanship, we will be using Oils as Sharpening Stones are typically reserved for melee DPS. There are also glove enchants which can assist with professions gather speed or make your hearthstone quicker.</p>
            <h4>Best Marksmanship Hunter Enchants</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Weapon:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Single Target: Sinful Revelation</li>
                <li>AoE: Optical Target Embiggener</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Chest:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Single Target: Eternal Skirmish</li>
                <li>AoE: Eternal Stats</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Cloak: Fortified Leech</li>
              <li>Rings: Enchant Ring - Tenet of Critical Strike or  Enchant Ring - Tenet of Mastery</li>
              <li>Boots: Eternal Agility</li>
            </ul>
            <p>*For Kyrian Hunters specifically,  Enchant Weapon - Celestial Guidance may be a better choice of weapon enchant over  Optical Target Embiggener due to the amount of Critical Strike obtained from  Resonating Arrow. As always, it is recommend to sim yourself.</p>
            <p>Players must acquire their enchants from Enchanters, or buy them off the Auction House. For Hunters, scopes (weapon enchants) are made by Engineers. For crafters, recipes in Shadowlands require different quest chains, and once completed, enchants can be made at low levels. Learn more about Enchanting and Engineering in our <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guides/shadowlands-enchanting-profession">Shadowlands Enchanting Guide</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guides/shadowlands-engineering-profession">Engineering Guide</a>.</p>
            <h4>Best Marksmanship Hunter Gems</h4>
            <p>In Shadowlands, all gems fit with all sockets and there is no bonus for putting in certain types of gems in particular slots.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You should have a single  Leviathan's Eye of Agility in your first available socket.
      </li>
              <li>All other gems should be  Deadly Jewel Cluster or  Masterful Jewel Cluster.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sockets work differently in Shadowlands! Now only Helms, Rings, Necks, Bracers, and Belts can have sockets on them. Similar to before, those specific slots have a random chance to roll a socket when obtaining them. In Shadowlands, questing in the Maw allows you to buy sockets to place on your gear. Ve'nari, a friendly NPC located in the Maw, will sell a consumable that works similar to  Gouged Eye of N'Zoth purchased with  Stygia - a currency farmed within the Maw.</p>
            <h4>Best Marksmanship Hunter Food & Drink</h4>
            <p>Similar to previous expansions, players have the option to use a Feast, or to use personal food.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Marksmanship Hunters should use  Feast of Gluttonous Hedonism when possible.</li>
              <li>If not,  Spinefin Souffle and Fries or  Iridescent Ravioli with Apple Sauce.
      </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Food can be crafted by any player with the Cooking profession that has learned the Battle for Azeroth recipes. Learn more about acquiring recipes in the Shadowlands <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guides/shadowlands-cooking-profession">Cooking Guide</a>.</p>
            <h4>Best Marksmanship Hunter Consumables</h4>
            <p>We have a ton of consumables to keep track of heading into Shadowlands. Below are the ones that Marksmanship Hunters should be concerned with.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Healing Potion: Spiritual Healing Potion</li>
              <li>Flask: Spectral Flask of Power</li>
              <li>Oils: Shadowcore Oil</li>
              <li>Potions: Potion of Spectral Agility</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note:  Potion of Phantom Fire is comparable to  Potion of Spectral Agility in pure single target and is generally way cheaper. Feel free to use it as a cheaper alternative. Additionally, ranged DPS are now required to use  Shadowcore Oil. It can be applied in addition to your standard weapon enchant (Shadowcore Oil amplifies damage done by Potion of Phantom Fire if you happen to be using them).</p>
            <p>Flasks and potions can be crafted by a level 60 Alchemists that have completed the questline to unlock them. Learn more about Alchemy in the Shadowlands <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guides/shadowlands-alchemy-profession">Alchemy Guide</a>.</p>

          <header>Legendaries</header>
          <article>
            <p>Marksmanship Hunters don't have too many legendaries to choose from luckily. We'll primarily be using  Serpentstalker's Trickery in most forms of content. With the addition of covenant-specific legendaries, each covenant has a few options now, depending on the type of content you'll be doing. Additionally, Sanctum of Domination introduces  Rae'shalare, Death's Whisper, a legendary drop from Sylvanas Windrunner herself. It's important to note that the bow is not a unique-equip legendary and our other legendaries can be equipped simultaneously.</p>
            <p>Sanctum of Domination also introduces Domination Sockets. These 5 sockets will restrict where you will be crafting your legendaries. It'll be important to avoid crafting legendaries in the Head, Chest, Shoulders, Wasite, and Feet slots. Similar to Castle Nathria, Sanctum of Domination also has higher item-level pieces that drop from both Kel'thuzad and Sylvanas. Again, this further restricts which slots we'll want to craft certain legendaries in.</p>
            <p>Below I break down each legendary and give some explanation as to why it's good, bad, or used in certain scenarios, along with which slot is more ideal when crafting (or re-crafting).</p>
            <h4>Best Legendaries for Raiding</h4>
            <p>Serpentstalker's Trickery is hands down our best option for Raid. The majority of fights are single-target focused. All covenants should prioritize crafting and upgrading this legendary. Kyrians also have the option of crafting  Pact of the Soulstalkers to buff their allies, which may or may not be beneficial depending on your raid composition.</p>
            <p>Depending on whether or not you'll need AoE, you may want to craft/upgrade the following legendaries depending on your covenant.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Kyrians should invest in  Surging Shots.</li>
              <li>Venthyrs should invest in  Pouch of Razor Fragments.</li>
              <li>Necrolords should invest in  Bag of Munitions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are a few fights in Sanctum of Domination that might require AoE, so it's probably worth investing in them, but regardless,  Serpentstalker's Trickery will be a solid legendary to fall back on.</p>
            <h4>Best Legendaries for Mythic+</h4>
            <p>Mythic+ is a bit more straightforward. Each covenant has a recommended AoE option.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Kyrians should invest in  Surging Shots.</li>
              <li>Venthyrs should invest in  Pouch of Razor Fragments.</li>
              <li>Necrolords should invest in  Bag of Munitions.</li>
              <li>Night Faes should invest in  Serpentstalker's Trickery.</li>
              <p>In general, the above legendaries are a good choice for each respective covenant. If you need more single target-oriented damage for Tyrannical weeks or even in Theatre of Pain,  Serpentstalker's Trickery is a solid choice regardless of your covenant.</p>
            </ul>
